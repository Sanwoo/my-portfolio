# Portfolio of Ounce

## Project completion thought process

This is a portfolio page made by Ounce in few days according to the recruitment requirements of Immortal Dragons company.

At the beginning of all, I noticed the part related to the effectiveness of the written test requirements, so I started learning the basic usage of Three.js and found some earth texture maps online.Then the Earth.tsx component was created.

After that, I started making the main body of the webpage, mainly consisting of four sections and some animation effects. Among them, I utilized Shadcn UI and some of its derivative UI libraries, as well as motion/react.

After completing all of this, I used Tailwindcss to perform some simple mobile adaptation on the webpage as required

At the same time, the AI assistant dialogue function in the bottom left corner of the page has been implemented, and the Deepseek model has been integrated. Click to experience it

Due to limited development time, many interesting ideas have not yet been implemented and added to the page. I will continue to improve them in the future when I have time

## Main technology stack

React + Typescript + Tailwindcss + motion + Shadcn UI + Three.js + Email.js
